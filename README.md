# J20 - Joyful Cooking Tasteful Living

Welcome to the backend repository of our Recipe Web Capstone Project! This backend server acts as a bridge between users and our recipe database. Users can explore recipes and provide feedback or make requests through the "Contact Us" feature.

## Features

1. **Recipe Search:** Users can easily find recipes they desire by searching through our extensive database.

2. **Contact Us Form:**
   - **Name:** Users can provide their name.
   - **Email:** Users can input their email address.
   - **Subject:** Specify the purpose of their message.
   - **Message:** A text box for users to give feedback or make requests.

## Contact Us Functionality

When users submit the contact form:
- The backend processes the data.
- Sends the data to the server hosted on [Railway](https://railway.app/).
- Additionally, the data is stored in a MySQL server, also hosted on [Railway](https://railway.app/).

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the server with `npm start`.

Ensure you have a valid configuration file with your Railway and MySQL server credentials.
